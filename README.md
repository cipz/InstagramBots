# InstagramBots

This repo has been created out of boredom.

## The bots
Here is a list of the bots currently present in this repo:
- [astronomy_picture_of_the_day](https://www.instagram.com/starsfromnasa/): NASA has a website called [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/), which stands for ***A**stronomy **P**icture **O**f the **D**ay*, this ~~little guy~~ bot (the first one I've done), posts the picture of the day, every day (unless it's a video or a gif, more in the [Limitations](#limitations) section)
- [the_new_yorker](https://www.instagram.com/newyorkermagcovers/): I like the covers of [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine) (amazing weekly magazine) but there was no account with their covers. Now there is :)
- [wikipedia_featured_article](https://www.instagram.com/wikipediaarticledaily/): like NASA, Wikipedia has a [Today's featured article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_article) section from which i take the picture and description and post them to IG
- [wikipedia_featured_picture](https://www.instagram.com/): like the prvious one, but the focus is on the [Picture of the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Picture_of_the_day) page
- [zanichelli_parola_del_giorno](https://www.instagram.com/paroladelgiornozanichelli/): the [Zanichelli](http://dizionari.zanichelli.it/) is a famous italian dictionary which, you guessed it, has a [word of the day section](https://dizionaripiu.zanichelli.it/cultura-e-attualita/le-parole-del-giorno/parola-del-giorno/). I take the word and the meaning and post them in Instagram.

## How it works

## Libraries and other dependencies

## Limitations
Unfortunately [the Facebook team](https://github.com/facebook) (who currently owns Instagram, among a thousand other things), does not like bots nor developers or amateur coders that want to do simple projects like this one, so they always change APIs and block requests from third party libraries.
***[igbot](https://github.com/ohld/igbot/)*** and other libraries such as ***[instagram_private_api](https://github.com/ping/instagram_private_api/)*** are currently being blocked or are not up to date with the APIs from FB.
